01:04 22/06/2011 - Added intial support for OpenFeint. You will need to download the SDK seperatly for openfeint and then add it as a library into this project!

Currently the waves are infinite!

I have as yet to test how far and well the waves go.
The higher the wave number the more enemies there will be.
It is a very basic algorithm at the moment.



Found some bugs/glitch's ?
Create an issue with the best description as to what and how it's happening.

		___ TESTED ANDROID VERSIONS ___

**NOTE: This list has been compiled from AVD's within the SDK**
**NOTE2: The testing done was to see if they installed and loaded successfully, game play has not been significantly tested**

Android 1.5 - (Works, but not designed for it!)
Android 1.6 - (Works, but not designed for it!)
Android 2.1.update_1 - (Works, but not designed for it!)
Android 2.2 - (Works, Game designed to work well with 2.2 and up)
Android 2.3.1 - (Works)
Android 2.3.3 - (Works)
Android 3.0 - (Works, with performance/install issues, but I think those are down to the SDK/AVD)
Android 3.1 - (Works, with performance/install issues, but I think those are down to the SDK/AVD)



		<-- Tested Resolutions -->
		
QVGA (240 x 320) -> Works
HVGA (320 x 480) -> Works
WQVGA (240 x 400) -> Works
WQVGA (200 x 432) -> Works
WVGA (480 x 800) -> Works
WVGA (480 x 854) -> Works
WXGA (1280 x 800){tablets} -> HA Awesome, Works but needs entirely new sprites for this size.

** NOTE **
**The above resolutions were all on devices/AVD's that have portrait screens (Width is smaller than the height)
**If you Have a screen that is larger in width than height in portrait mode, it will not scale porperly at all (Work in progress to attempt to get this working)
